# Recipe Project

## Context
This project was completed to practice frontend development skills with React by creating a simple CRUD app for creating and listing cooking recipes.

## How to Use
1. Fork and clone repo
2. npm install
3. Start with Live Server (VSCode)

The code can be demonstrated using a local test web server (e.g., with the Live Server extension for VSCode) which will render the simple HTML file and corresponding React components. The UI will look similar to this:

The user can enter information in the HTML form fields and click "create" to add a new recipe to the display. Clicking "delete" on any one of the recipes removes that recipe from the display. Images of each recipe are added in the form of the URL of the image file.

## Features
The application features the basic CRUD operations for the recipes added via React's built-in useState component. No external database is used.

## Technologies and Tools
-- JavaScript/ HTML/ CSS

-- React

## Conclusion
Future goals for this project include incorporating pieces of code, methodology, styling techniques, and application structure to other more sophisticated projects.
